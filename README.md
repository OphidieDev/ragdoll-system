## Ragdoll System

This is a system that implements ragdoll physics for roblox games. This system works out of the box for characters and npcs that follow an R6 or R15 character layout. Player ragdolls are created automatically on the server, and only the local player on the client, without the need for any input from you.
The system also automatically creates ragdolls for npcs on the server, simply give the npc model the tag Ragdoll and RagdollSystem will do the rest. All you have to do is drop the system anywhere that both the client and the server can reach it such as ReplicatedStorage.
